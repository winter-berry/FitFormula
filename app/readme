Take note of naming conventions for buttons, imageViews, textViews, etc.

- Type of asset
- Page name (Caps)
- Description (Caps)

So an imageView for a profile on the Home page should be named as follows: "iv_Home_Profile"

All GUI layouts go in the "layout" folder.
All other assets go in the "drawables" folder.
All animations go in the "anim" folder.
Define commonly used colors in "colors.xml". Same for "strings.xml".
